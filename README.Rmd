<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of chewie is to make downloading GEDI data much faster and simpler. 
Right now, in order to download a small area of GEDI, you are required to 
download very large files with irrelevant data. This package aims to overcome
this issue by using the hdf5 driver from gdal to download only the data you need.

The data should be saved as a geoarrow format and we should provide functions
to enable efficient cleaning and filtering. 

This package should not be a full suit of tools for working with GEDI data, but
a simple, light and information-rich way to access the data.

At present the rGEDI package is the best option for downloading raw GEDI data 
but its functionality is very large and goes beyond just downloading data. 
As a result installation is not always straightforward.


TO DO:

- [ ] Add a function to download the data

- [ ] Add a function to clean the data

- [ ] Add a function to filter the data

- [ ] Add a function to plot the data

- [ ] Add a functionality to get level 4a data


## Installation

You can install the development version of chewie like so:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("Permian-Global-Research/chewie")
```


```{r example}
library(chewie)

# chewie_creds() # to set up your credentials

nc <- system.file("gpkg", "nc.gpkg", package = "sf")
nc_sf <- sf::read_sf(nc)

gedi_nc_2a <- chewie_find(nc_sf,
  gedi_product = "2A", gedi_version = "v2",
  date_start = "2020-01-01"
)


swaths_img <- chewie_show(gedi_nc_2a, interactive=FALSE)
```
